This is an Android SDK project that displays preview images
from the camera.  The initial source came from the 
Andorid API Demos.

http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/graphics/CameraPreview.html

This project targets Android API Level 10 (Android 2.3.3).  This level
gives us access to Camera.CameraInfo which allows us to select between
front and back cameras.
